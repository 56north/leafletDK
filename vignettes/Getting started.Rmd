leafletDK is a package that makes it easy to create interactive dynamic leaflet maps based on danish administrative areas

The package is heavily inspired by the amazing mapDK package by Sebastian Barfort, which I recommend if you want to create static high quality maps.

## Getting started

It is really easy to use leafletDK. Simply call the administrative area that you want to map (like a municipality) and give it the data you want the map to be colored by.

Below is an example where we load data from Statistics Denmark and map it using leaflet.

```
library(leafletDK)

folk1 <- read.csv2("http://api.statbank.dk/v1/data/folk1/CSV?OMR%C3%85DE=*",
                     stringsAsFactors = F)

municipalityDK("INDHOLD", "OMRÅDE", data = folk1)

municipalityDK("INDHOLD", "OMRÅDE", subplot = c("frederiksberg","hvidovre"), data = folk1)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7}
library(leafletDK)

folk1 <- read.csv2("http://api.statbank.dk/v1/data/folk1/CSV?OMR%C3%85DE=*",
                     stringsAsFactors = F)

municipalityDK("INDHOLD", "OMRÅDE", data = folk1)

```
